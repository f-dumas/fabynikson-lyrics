# Dome & Little Boy

> Lyrics by Faby Nikson

```
Proudly standing in the center of the city
At that time, no one really noticed you
But a little boy had heard you were great
He came from far away to see you

Did the little boy only want to play, along to you, Dome? He's far away.

**Chorus**
Who thought you'd be the only one who'd survive?
When everything collapsed everywhere around you.
People now gather around to pray and cry
Cause someone was greed way too much not to try.

Proudly playing around you, the other kids
Didn't expect such an invading visit.
They saw the Little Boy coming
At 8.15 the other way.
And he didn't come to play, that's fair to say.

**Chorus**

The little boy didn't come to play, along to you, Dome... That's fair to say.
The little boy didnâ€™t come to play... He came to suck your life away!

**Chorus**
```
